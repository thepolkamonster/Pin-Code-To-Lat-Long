## Pin-Code-To-Lat-Long

Make sure to set the file name as Pin-codes.csv

This is a simple program to convert the given pin code to its latitude and longitude,
I ran into this problem when i was doing a project so i decided to share this solution

The code uses a prefil **in** becuase the pin codes that i needed to preoccess were from india so feel free to edit that.

The program takes a csv file as it;s input with 1 column called "Pin code msub" and gives the output as a csv file with the latiude and longitude attributes added to it.
